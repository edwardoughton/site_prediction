Site Prediction
================

In this repo we build code which can help to predict cellular site density for
countries around the world.

Datasets are widely developed to help the analysis of energy, water or transport networks.
Indeed, estimating the number of people who do not have access to electricity is a highly
developed research area within sustainability science, energy policy etc. and is essential
information for meeting the infrastructure-related Sustainable Development Goals.

However, we currently lack this information to help us understand how many people are
connected to a basic 2G voice phone serice, or indeed to the internet (via 3G, 4G or 5G). This
is highly surprising given how important internet access is in revolutionizing economic
development opportunities.

We're open to co-authorship on this work from anyone who can provide cellular site data to help
validate the predictive models developed.
